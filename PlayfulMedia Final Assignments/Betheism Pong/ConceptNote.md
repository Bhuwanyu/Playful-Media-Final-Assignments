# Concept Note: Recontextualizing Pong — Bitheism Pong

## Personal Interpretation:
Bitheism is the belief in two gods. Equal yet distinct divine forces that coexist in harmony or opposition. It represents the constant tension and balance between two powers, each governing their own domain while influencing the other. I interpret bitheism as a metaphor for dual control, interdependence, and equilibrium, where both forces must act together to maintain balance.

## Modified Pong Rules:
In this reimagined version of Pong, each player embodies two gods by controlling two paddles - one vertical and one horizontal.

Player 1: Controls the left vertical paddle using W/S and the upper horizontal paddle using A/D.

Player 2: Controls the right vertical paddle using ↑/↓ and the bottom horizontal paddle using ←/→.

The ball bounces off paddles only — if it escapes through a player’s sides (left/top for Player 1 or right/bottom for Player 2), the opponent scores. Each hit gradually increases the ball’s speed, symbolizing rising divine tension.

## Embodiment of Bitheism:
This dual-paddle system mirrors the essence of bitheism — two divine entities sharing power and responsibility within one realm. Players must balance control over two domains simultaneously, embodying cooperation between twin deities. The slow, steady increase in ball speed reflects the growing intensity of their eternal struggle for equilibrium — a metaphor for the delicate balance between two divine forces that define creation and chaos alike.
